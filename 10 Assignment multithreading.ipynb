    "Concurrent Execution: Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently within a program, \n",

    "Responsiveness: Multithreading enhances the responsiveness of a program by keeping the application interactive \n",

    "Resource Sharing: Threads within a process can share the same memory space, enabling efficient sharing of \n",

    "Efficiency: Multithreading can improve overall system efficiency by making better use of available system \n",
    "resources, such as multiple CPU cores, and achieving parallelism for tasks that can be executed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Design: Multithreading can simplify the design and implementation of complex applications by \n",

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreaded programming introduces additional complexity, making the code harder to design, \n",

    "\n",
    "Increased Debugging Difficulty: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to the non-deterministic \n",
    "nature of thread execution and the potential for subtle timing-related bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Contentions: Multithreading can lead to resource contention issues when multiple threads compete for \n",

    "No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread or process; they can only be released voluntarily.\n",

    "Circular Wait: There must be a circular chain of two or more threads or processes, where each is waiting for a \n",
