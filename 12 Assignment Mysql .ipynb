    "\n",
    "#Answer :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''  database is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, \n",
    "management, and manipulation of information. It is designed to store large amounts of data and provide mechanisms \n",
    "for accessing and querying that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, \n",
    "and usage scenarios. Here's a brief differentiation between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational data model, where data is organized into tables \n",
    "with predefined schemas. Some characteristics of SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases have a predefined structure with tables, columns, and relationships defined by a schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: They enforce data integrity through constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique \n",
    "constraints.\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL offers powerful querying \n",
    "capabilities, including joins, aggregations, and complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Transactions: SQL databases generally support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, \n",
    "ensuring data consistency and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases employ various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph, to store \n",
    "and retrieve data. They provide flexible schema designs and horizontal scalability. Key points about NoSQL databases \n",
    "include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema Flexibility: NoSQL databases allow for dynamic and flexible schema designs. They can handle unstructured or \n",
    "semi-structured data more easily than SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, allowing them to handle large volumes of data and \n",
    "high traffic loads efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: NoSQL databases may have their own query languages or APIs specific to the data model they employ. \n",
    "Some offer SQL-like query languages, while others use custom APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: NoSQL databases are often optimized for high-speed data access and can deliver better performance \n",
    "for specific use cases like real-time analytics or content management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB, Apache HBase.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the \n",
    "application, including the nature of the data, scalability needs, performance expectations, and development preferences.   '''"

    "such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints. Here's an explanation of the commonly used DDL statements with examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object. It can be used to create tables, indexes, views, procedures,\n",
    "and other objects. Here's an example of creating a table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary \n",
    "in SQL syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(50),\n",

    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It can be used to add, modify, or delete \n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD Department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all the data from a table, while keeping the structure intact. It is faster than the \n",

    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: A primary key must contain unique values for each row in the table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot contain null values. Every row must have a valid value for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-Attribute or Composite: A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns that form a composite primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints: A primary key enforces data integrity by automatically preventing duplicate or null values in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: A primary key is typically indexed, which allows for faster data retrieval and efficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table named \"Customers\" with columns such as CustomerID, Name, Email, and Address. In this case, the CustomerID \n",

    "2. execute():\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method is called on the cursor object (`mycursor.execute(query)`) to execute SQL queries.\n",
    "   - It takes an SQL query as an argument and executes it on the connected database.\n",
    "   - You can pass parameters to the query using placeholders (%s, %d, etc.) and provide the values as a tuple or dictionary.\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method is used for queries like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.\n",
