    "\n",
    "Example: Weather API\n",
    "A common example of API usage is a weather API. Weather services provide APIs that allow developers to access \n",
    "weather data programmatically. Developers can send requests to the weather API, specifying the location or coordinates,\n",
    " and the API responds with weather information for that location. The response can include data such as temperature, \n",
    " humidity, wind speed, and forecasts.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "By using a weather API, developers can leverage the existing weather data and functionality provided by the weather \n",
    "service without having to build their own weather database or weather prediction algorithms. APIs allow developers to \n",

    "''' Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API. '''\n",
    "\n",
    "#ANSWER :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''  Advantages of using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integration and interoperability: APIs enable seamless integration and interoperability between different \n",
    "systems and services. They allow applications to communicate and share data, facilitating the exchange of \n",
    "information and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reusability and efficiency: APIs promote reusability of code and resources. By providing well-defined interfaces, \n",
    "APIs allow developers to leverage existing functionalities and services, saving time and effort in development. This\n",
    " promotes efficiency and accelerates the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extensibility and scalability: APIs provide a way to extend the functionality of an application by integrating with\n",
    "external services and resources. This enables developers to add new features, services, or data sources to their applications\n",
    " without reinventing the wheel. APIs also allow applications to scale by leveraging the resources and capabilities of external \n",
    " systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexibility and customization: APIs offer flexibility and customization options. Developers can choose which APIs to integrate \n",
    "based on their specific needs, allowing them to tailor their applications to meet specific requirements. APIs also provide various \n",
    "parameters and options to customize the behavior and data returned, enabling developers to fine-tune the integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Ecosystem and innovation: APIs foster the creation of ecosystems and spur innovation. By exposing their services and data through \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs, organizations encourage developers to build upon their platforms, create new applications, and drive innovation. This leads to \n",
    "the development of a vibrant ecosystem of interconnected applications and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dependency on external services: When relying on external APIs, applications become dependent on the availability and \n",
    "stability of those APIs. If an API experiences downtime or undergoes changes, it can impact the functionality and \n",
    "performance of the dependent \n",
    "applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of control: When using third-party APIs, developers have limited control over the implementation, performance, and s\n",
    "ecurity of the API. They need to trust the API provider to maintain and update the API appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Versioning and compatibility: APIs can undergo updates and changes over time. This may introduce versioning and compatibility \n",
    "issues for applications that rely on specific API versions or have implemented their logic based on the API's previous behavior.\n",
    " Developers need to manage and adapt to these changes to ensure the continued functionality of their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Security and privacy concerns: Integrating external APIs introduces potential security and privacy risks. Developers need to \n",
    "carefully assess the security practices and protocols of the API providers to ensure the protection of sensitive data exchanged \n",
    "between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance and latency: The use of APIs can introduce additional latency and performance overhead due to the network \n",
    "communication and data transfer involved. The response time of an API can impact the overall performance and user \n",
    "experience of an application, \n",
    "especially if the API is slow or unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important for developers to consider these advantages and disadvantages when deciding to use APIs and choose \n",
    "reliable and well-documented APIs that align with their application's requirements and goals.  '''"

    "REST Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is an architectural style that emphasizes a stateless, client-server communication model for web services.\n",
    "RESTful APIs are based on a set of principles and constraints, making them simple, lightweight, and easy to understand.\n",
    "REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources identified \n",

    "\n",
    "REST APIs often return data in lightweight and widely supported formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) \n",

    "REST promotes scalability, loose coupling between components, and a uniform interface that can be easily consumed by clients.\n",
    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol and architectural style that provides a standardized approach for exchanging structured\n",
    " information in web services.\n",
    "SOAP-based APIs use XML as the format for messages exchanged between the client and the server.\n",
    "SOAP APIs typically rely on the SOAP envelope, which wraps the message payload and includes information about \n",

    "SOAP supports various transport protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and more, and can be used across different\n",
    " network protocols.\n",
    "SOAP places a strong emphasis on extensibility, error handling, and security features.\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP is known for its complexity in terms of message structure and protocol. SOAP messages are \n",
    "typically larger due to the XML format, which can increase bandwidth usage and processing time.\n",

    "Overhead: SOAP has a higher overhead compared to REST due to the extensive XML parsing and processing required. \n",

    "Limited platform support: While SOAP can be used with different transport protocols, it is mainly associated with \n",
    "HTTP and may not be as well-supported on all platforms and programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of flexibility: SOAP relies on a rigid contract-based approach, where a strict agreement between the client \n",

    "\n",
    "Integration complexity: Integrating SOAP-based APIs often requires the use of specific libraries and tools, which \n",

    "1. Architecture Style:\n",
    "   - REST: REST is an architectural style that follows a stateless, client-server communication model. It emphasizes \n",
    "   a uniform interface, scalability, and simplicity.\n",
    "   - SOAP: SOAP is a protocol and architectural style that focuses on exchanging structured information in web \n",
