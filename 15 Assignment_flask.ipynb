    "''' Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework? '''\n",
    "\n",
    "#ANSWER :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''  Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to be lightweight, flexible, \n",
    "and easy to use, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity: Flask follows a minimalist philosophy, providing only the essentials for web development. \n",
    "It has a small and easy-to-understand codebase, which makes it approachable for developers of all skill levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexibility: Flask allows developers to choose and integrate components based on their specific needs. \n",
    "It does not impose any particular directory structure or dependencies, giving developers the freedom to o\n",
    "rganize their code as they see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extensibility: Flask provides a modular design, allowing developers to easily add or remove features using \n",
    "its extensive ecosystem of extensions. There are numerous Flask extensions available for tasks such as database \n",
    "integration, form validation, authentication, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lightweight: Flask is known for its lightweight nature. It does not have a lot of overhead and does not\n",
    "require a large amount of code or resources to run. This makes it well-suited for developing efficient and \n",
    "fast applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Testability: Flask provides a built-in testing framework that makes it easy to write and execute tests for \n",
    "your application. It provides tools for simulating requests, handling responses, and asserting expected behaviors, \n",
    "enabling developers to thoroughly test their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Documentation and Community: Flask has extensive documentation that covers various aspects of the framework and \n",
    "provides helpful examples. Additionally, Flask has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its \n",
    "ecosystem, offer support, and share their knowledge and experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Pythonic: Flask embraces the Python programming language and its principles. It leverages Python's simplicity,\n",
    "readability, and expressive syntax, making it familiar and comfortable for Python developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Flask offers a balance between simplicity and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for small to\n",
    "medium-sized web applications or APIs, where a lightweight and customizable framework is preferred.  '''"

    "''' Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes? '''\n",
    "\n",
    "#ANSWER :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''  In Flask, app routing refers to the process of mapping URL paths to functions or views \n",
    "that handle the corresponding requests. It allows you to define routes for different URLs and \n",
    "specify the functions or methods that will be executed when those URLs are accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a request is made to a Flask application, the app routing system matches the requested URL \n",
    "against the defined routes to determine which function should be called to handle the request. \n",
    "This function is commonly referred to as a view function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using app routes offers several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing: It enables you to define clean and meaningful URLs for your application, making it easier \n",
    "for users and search engines to navigate and understand the structure of your website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of Concerns: Routes allow you to separate different functionalities or pages of your \n",
    "application into individual view functions. This promotes modularity and maintainability by keeping\n",
    "the code for each page or endpoint isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs: App routing is particularly useful when building RESTful APIs, as you can define\n",
    "routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and map them to the corresponding \n",
    "functions that handle those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Routing: Flask also supports dynamic routes by using URL parameters. This allows you to \n",
    "handle URLs with variable parts, such as passing an ID or a username as part of the URL.'''\n"
