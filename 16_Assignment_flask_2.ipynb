    "\n",
    "'''  \n",
    "In Flask, the redirect() function is used to redirect the user's browser to a different URL. It is a convenient way to navigate users to another route or page within your Flask application or even to an external URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of using redirect() is to perform URL redirection, which can be useful in various scenarios, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing to a different route: You can use redirect() to send the user to a different route within your Flask application. This can be helpful when you want to direct users to another page after a specific action or when handling certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling form submissions: After processing a form submission, it is often desirable to redirect the user to another page rather than displaying a static response. redirect() allows you to redirect the user to a different URL after form processing, providing a seamless user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling authentication and authorization: When dealing with authentication and authorization in Flask, redirect() can be used to redirect users to login pages or access-denied pages if they are not authenticated or authorized to access a particular resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "External URL redirection: redirect() can also be used to redirect users to external websites or resources. This is helpful when you want to redirect users to a different domain or an external service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of redirect() in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, when the user visits the root URL (/), the index() function redirects them to the hello() function using redirect() and url_for(). As a result, the user's browser is redirected to the /hello URL, and the message \"Hello, World!\" is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, redirect() is a handy function in Flask that allows you to control the flow of your application by directing users to different routes or external URLs. It provides flexibility and helps create dynamic and interactive web applications.\n",
