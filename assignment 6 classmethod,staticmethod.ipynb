Name the four pillars of OOPs.\\n\\n\\n#Answer:\\n\\n\\nEncapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. \\nIt allows data to be hidden from the outside and accessed only through defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, \\ndata hiding, and improved code maintainability.\\n\\nInheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). \\nThe derived classes inherit the properties and behaviors of the base class, allowing code reuse and the ability to extend or modify\\n the inherited functionality. Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the concept of hierarchical classification.\\n\\nPolymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on different forms or have multiple behaviors depending on the context. \\nIt allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method \\noverriding and method overloading. It enhances flexibility, extensibility, and code organization.\\n\\nAbstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features and hiding unnecessary details. \\nIt focuses on providing a clear and concise interface for interacting with objects, while hiding the underlying implementation complexities. \\nAbstraction allows developers to create abstract classes and interfaces that define common behavior and characteristics without specifying \\nthe specific implementation.\\n\\n'"
