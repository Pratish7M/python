    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''In Python, data abstraction can be achieved through the use of classes and objects. Abstraction is a fundamental \n",
    "principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to represent complex systems by hiding unnecessary details \n",
    "and exposing only the essential features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key concepts and techniques for achieving data abstraction in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects: Classes are the blueprints that define the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are instances \n",
    "of classes. Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single entity. By creating classes, you can \n",
    "abstract away the implementation details and provide a clean interface for working with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and related methods together within a class, thereby hiding the \n",
    "internal details of the class from outside access. It allows you to control the access to data and enforce proper usage through \n",
    "methods. Encapsulation helps in achieving information hiding and protecting the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifiers: In Python, access modifiers are achieved through naming conventions rather than language-enforced keywords like \n",
    "in some other programming languages. By convention, attributes and methods that start with a single underscore _ are considered \n",
    "\"internal\" and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. Attributes and methods starting with double underscores\n",
    " __ (name mangling) are considered \"private\" and have limited access. This convention helps in controlling access to data and \n",
    " promoting encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getter and Setter Methods: Getter and setter methods provide controlled access to class attributes. They allow you to retrieve \n",
    "the value of an attribute (getter) or modify its value (setter) while enforcing any necessary validations or transformations. \n",
    "By using getter and setter methods, you can abstract away the details of how the attribute is stored and provide a consistent \n",
    "interface for accessing and modifying data.'''"

    "\n",
